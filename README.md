## vision.js

This project is the development of a Computer Vision framework in JavaScript, using the HTML5's getUserMedia() API.

#### Requirements

Since the getUserMedia() API is not supported in all browsers, there are only 2 requirements for running this project:
- [Chrome](http://www.google.com/intl/pt-BR/chrome/) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/new/)  
- A webcam.
